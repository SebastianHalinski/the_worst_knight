The worst knight in the kingdom

One day the worst knight in the kingdom met a gorgeous princess. He fell in love with her immediately however she could not stand to look at him. 
“Did it hurt?” - the knight said
“What hurts?” - answered the princess 
“When you did fall from the sky, my angel?” - said the knight with his sexy voice
“Go away, moron” - she answered angrily.
A few days pass and the knight heard rumors that she was kidnapped by an evil alien. The worst knight was looking all around the kingdom for the princess, he rode 15 kilometres on his horse and there no sign of her. He went to tavern and got totally wasted by 2 beers. The next day he met a mighty wizzard who told that the princess is in the next village in a orange barn. After 3 days of  curing hangover he went there. That where the story begins…..
